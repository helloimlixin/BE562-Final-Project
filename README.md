# BE562 Final Project
*A Combinatorial Optimization Framework for phylogenetic tree reconstruction of tumor cells using the Steiner interpretation of Parsimony Trees.*

## Introduction
This is the Project Repository for our Final Term Project for course ***BE562: Computational Biology, Genomes, Networks, Evolution (Fall 2018)***. In this project, our team implemented various approaches to tackle to problem of **Phylogenetic Tree Reconstruction** for tumor progression based on the data available. First, we implemented an **Exact Algorithm**, which works fine for smaller data size, but the computational complexity will become intractable for even moderate amount of data. Later, we implemented a **Simple Heuristic Search Algorithm** to produce an approximated result while remaining polynomial time complexity. The algorithm produces good results for some of the data, however, for the drastically varied tumor cell data, the algorithm does not generate satisfying performces. To further improve our phylogenetic tree reconstruction algorithm, we adopted the idea of picking *dominant* nodes by utilizing the monotonicity of the data (distance from the root node is increasing as the offspring branches go deeper). The improved algorithm has almost similar polynomial complexity as well as a better robustness while dealing with the volatile tumor genetic data.
