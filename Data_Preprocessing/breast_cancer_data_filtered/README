This directory contains FISH data on 26 samples from 13 individuals
with breast cancer [1]. Patients B1 through B13 each have samples
for ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC).
In each of 13 subdirectories, there are two data files, one labeled
with DCIS in the name and the other labeled with IDC in the name.

The original data were filtered as described in [1] to eliminated
likely cut nuclei. The files are in the input format expected by
the software FISHtrees [2].

Each patient data file is in tab-delimited columns with two header rows.
<header row 1> :- <number chromosome probes> <chromosome probe 1> ... \
                  <number gene probes> <gene probe 1> ...
<header row 2> :- <number of sample cell patterns> <number of sample cells>
<pattern row 1> :- <copy number of chromosome probe 1> ... \
                   <copy number of gene probe 1> ... \
                   <number of sample cells of this pattern>
...

There are <number of sample cell patterns> rows of
<number of sample cells of this pattern>, therefore all
<number of sample cells of this pattern> sum up to
<number of sample cells>.

The upper part of a patient data file looks as follows:

followed possibly by more rows of cell types.
In this data set, there are actually two chromosome probes: CEP10 and CEP4.
The column marked PLOIDY reflects one attempt to infer the
ploidy of the cell, as described in [1].
